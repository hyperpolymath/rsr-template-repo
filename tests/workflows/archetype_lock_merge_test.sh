# archetype_lock_merge_test.sh — an archetype's workflows reach a minted repo
# with their lock records, and the spine's workflows keep theirs.
#
# The julia-library overlay used to carry a whole actions.lock, and the
# overlay copy in `just repo-init` replaced the spine's lock with it. Every
# Julia mint (ZeroInflatedCounts.jl, ResidualEvidenceTypes.jl) began with Lock
# Sync red and its workflows refused at startup. The records now ship as
# archetypes/<name>/actions.lock and repo-init merges them in.
#
# Each check runs on a mint-shaped workflow directory: the spine's workflows
# plus the overlay's, under their minted names, with the lock repo-init writes.
#
#   positive    the merged lock passes scripts/check-lock-sync.sh
#   negative    the old shape (the fragment alone, as the copy left it) fails
#   negative    the merged lock minus one record the fragment added fails
#   negative    a fragment record that differs from the base's is refused,
#               and the base is left untouched
#   identity    merging an empty fragment rewrites the spine lock byte for byte
#   idempotent  merging the fragment twice changes nothing
#   wiring      build/just/repo-init.just still invokes the merge
#   shape       no overlay carries .github/workflows/actions.lock
#   headers     each overlay workflow passes workflow-linter.yml's SPDX and
#               top-level permissions predicates, which a minted repo runs
#
# A minted repo keeps this test and estate-rules.yml but not archetypes/,
# which repo-init deletes once the merge is done; there it skips.
